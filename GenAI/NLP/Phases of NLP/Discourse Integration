#### Discourse Integration ####

It is the process of understanding how individual sentences or segments of text connect and relate to each other within a broader context. 
This phase ensures that the meaning of a text is consistent and coherent across multiple sentences or paragraphs. It is important for understanding long or complex texts where meaning focuses on previous statements.

# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)

# Display coreference chains
for chain in doc._.coref_chains:
    print("Coreference Chain:")
    for mention in chain:
        print(f" - {mention.text}")
