##### Lexical and Morphological Analysis ####

1) ## Lexical Analysis
It focuses on identifying and processing words (or lexemes) in a text. It breaks down the input text into individual tokens that are meaningful units of language such as words or phrases.

Key tasks in Lexical analysis:

Tokenization: Process of dividing a text into smaller chunks called tokens. For example the sentence "I love programming" would be tokenized into ["I", "love", "programming"].
Part-of-Speech Tagging: Assigning parts of speech such as noun, verb, adjective to each token in the sentence. This helps us to understand grammatical roles of words in the context.
Example: Consider the sentence: "I am reading a book."

Tokenization: Sentence is broken down into individual tokens or words: ["I", "am", "reading", "a", "book"]
Part-of-Speech Tagging: Each token is assigned a part of speech: ["I" → Pronoun (PRP), "am" → Verb (VBP), "reading" → Verb (VBG), "a" → Article (DT), "book" → Noun (NN)]
Importance of Lexical Analysis

Word Identification: It breaks text into tokens which helps the system to understand individual words for further processing.
Text Simplification: It simplifies text through tokenization and stemming which improves accuracy in NLP tasks.

#lexical Analysis
!pip install spacy
import spacy

# Load spaCy's English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample sentence
sentence = "Harshad is learning NLP from scratch."

# Process the sentence
doc = nlp(sentence)
print("doc",doc)

# Tokenization
tokens = [token.text for token in doc]
print("Tokens:", tokens)

# Part-of-Speech Tagging
pos_tags = [(token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc]
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)

# Lemmatization
lemmas = [(token.text, token.lemma_) for token in doc]
print("Lemmas:", lemmas)

# Named Entity Recognition
entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
print("Named Entities:", entities)

2) ## Morphological Analysis ##
It deals with morphemes which are the smallest units of meaning in a word. It is important for understanding structure of words and their parts by identifying free morphemes (independent words like "cat") and bound morphemes (like prefixes or suffixes e.g. "un-" or "-ing").

Key tasks in morphological analysis:

Stemming: Reducing words to their root form like "running" to "run".
Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form considering the context like "better" becomes "good".
Importance of Morphological Analysis

Understanding Word Structure: It helps in breaking the composition of complex words.
Improving Accuracy: It enhances accuracy of tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing and machine translation.
