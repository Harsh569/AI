#### Semantic Analysis ####
Semantic Analysis focuses on understanding meaning behind words and sentences. It ensures that the text is not only grammatically correct but also logically coherent and contextually relevant. 
It aims to understand dictionary definitions of words and their usage in context and also find whether the arrangement of words in a sentence makes logical sense.

Key Tasks in Semantic Analysis
Named Entity Recognition (NER): It identifies and classifies entities such as names of people, locations, organizations, dates and more. These entities provide important meaning in the text and help in understanding the context. 
For example in the sentence "Tesla announced its new electric vehicle in California," NER would identify "Tesla" as an organization and "California" as a location.
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Many words have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they are used. It identifies the correct meaning of a word based on its surrounding text. For example word "bank" can refer to a 
financial institution or the side of a river. It uses context to identify which meaning applies in a given sentence which ensures that interpretation is accurate.
Example of Semantic Analysis
"Apple eats a John." while grammatically correct this sentence doesnâ€™t make sense semantically because an apple cannot "eat" a person. Semantic analysis ensures that the meaning is logically sound and contextually appropriate. 
It is important for various NLP applications including machine translation, information retrieval and question answering.
